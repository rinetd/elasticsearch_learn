The validate API allows a user to validate a potentially expensive query without executing it. The following example shows how it can be used:

curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/1' -d '{
    "user" : "kimchy",
    "post_date" : "2009-11-15T14:12:12",
    "message" : "trying out Elasticsearch"
}'
When the query is valid, the response contains valid:true:

curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/_validate/query?q=user:foo'
{"valid":true,"_shards":{"total":1,"successful":1,"failed":0}}

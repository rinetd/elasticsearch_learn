## elasticsearch can be started using:
$ bin/elasticsearch

## To run it in the background, add the -d switch to it:
$ bin/elasticsearch -d

## Another feature is the ability to pass -X and -D or getopt long style configuration parameters directly to the script.
## When set, all override anything set using either JAVA_OPTS or ES_JAVA_OPTS. For example:
$ bin/elasticsearch -Xmx2g -Xms2g -Des.index.store.type=memory --node.name=my-node

We recommend installing the Java 8 update 20 or later, or Java 7 update 55 or later


Virtual memory

sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

To set this value permanently, update the vm.max_map_count setting in /etc/sysctl.conf.

Disable swap
On Linux systems, you can disable swap temporarily by running: sudo swapoff -a. To disable it permanently,
you will need to edit the /etc/fstab file and comment out any lines that contain the word swap.

On Windows, the equivalent can be achieved by disabling the paging file entirely via System Properties →
 Advanced → Performance → Advanced → Virtual memory.

Configure swappiness
The second option is to ensure that the sysctl value vm.swappiness is set to 0.

The third option is to use mlockall on Linux/Unix systems, or VirtualLock on Windows,
to try to lock the process address space into RAM, preventing any Elasticsearch memory from being swapped out. This can be done, by adding this line to the config/elasticsearch.yml file:

bootstrap.mlockall: true

Elasticsearch Settings

The configuration format is YAML. Here is an example of changing the address all network based modules will use to bind and publish to:

network :
    host : 10.0.0.4

Pathsedit

In production use, you will almost certainly want to change paths for data and log files:

path:
  logs: /var/log/elasticsearch
  data: /var/data/elasticsearch

Cluster name

cluster:
  name: <NAME OF YOUR CLUSTER>

Node name

node:
  name: <NAME OF YOUR NODE>

node:
  name: ${HOSTNAME}

Index Settings

$ curl -XPUT http://localhost:9200/kimchy/ -d \
'
index :
    store:
        type: memory
'

Back Up Your Data!

1.0 and lateredit

To back up a running 1.0 or later system, it is simplest
to use the snapshot feature. See the complete instructions for backup and restore with snapshots.

This syntax applies to Elasticsearch 1.0 and later:

curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_cluster/settings -d '{
        "transient" : {
            "cluster.routing.allocation.enable" : "none"
        }
}'

curl -XPOST localhost:9200/_all/_flush/synced
Note that a synced flush call is a best effort operation. It will fail there are any pending indexing operations. It is safe to issue it multiple times if needed.

Shut down a single node within the cluster.
curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/nodes/_local/_shutdown'

Start the now upgraded node. Confirm that it joins the cluster.
Re-enable shard reallocation:
curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_cluster/settings -d '{
        "transient" : {
            "cluster.routing.allocation.enable" : "all"
        }
}'


Stop all Elasticsearch services on all nodes in the cluster.
        curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_shutdown'

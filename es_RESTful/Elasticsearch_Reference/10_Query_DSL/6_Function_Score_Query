Supported decay functionsedit

The DECAY_FUNCTION determines the shape of the decay:

gauss
Normal decay, computed as:

images/Gaussian.png

where images/sigma.png is computed to assure that the score takes the value decay at distance scale from origin+-offset

images/sigma_calc.png

See Normal decay, keyword gauss for graphs demonstrating the curve generated by the gauss function.

exp
Exponential decay, computed as:

where again the parameter images/lambda.png is computed to assure that the score takes the value decay at distance scale from origin+-offset

images/lambda_calc.png

See Exponential decay, keyword exp for graphs demonstrating the curve generated by the exp function.

linear
Linear decay, computed as:

images/Linear.png.

where again the parameter s is computed to assure that the score takes the value decay at distance scale from origin+-offset

images/s_calc.png

In contrast to the normal and exponential decay, this function actually sets the score to 0 if the field value exceeds twice the user given scale value.

See Linear decay, keyword linear for graphs demonstrating the curve generated by the linear function.

The get index API can also be applied to more than one index, or on all indices by using _all or * as index.


Filtering index informationedit

The information returned by the get API can be filtered to include only specific
features by specifying a comma delimited list of features in the URL:

$ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/_settings,_mappings'

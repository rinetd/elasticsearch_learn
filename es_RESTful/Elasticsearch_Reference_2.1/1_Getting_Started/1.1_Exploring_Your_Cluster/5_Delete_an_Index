curl -XDELETE 'localhost:9200/customer?pretty'
curl 'localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v'
And the response:

curl -XDELETE 'localhost:9200/customer?pretty'
{
  "acknowledged" : true
}
curl 'localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v'

Before we move on, letâ€™s take a closer look again at some of the API commands that we have learned so far:

curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/customer'
curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/customer/external/1' -d '
{
  "name": "John Doe"
}'
curl 'localhost:9200/customer/external/1'
curl -XDELETE 'localhost:9200/customer'
If we study the above commands carefully, we can actually see a pattern of how we access data in Elasticsearch. That pattern can be summarized as follows:

curl -X<REST Verb> <Node>:<Port>/<Index>/<Type>/<ID>

Step 1: Disable shard allocation
PUT /_cluster/settings
{
  "transient": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "none"
  }
}

Step 2: Stop non-essential indexing and perform a synced flush (Optional)edit

POST /_flush/synced

Step 3: Stop and upgrade a single node


Step 4: Start the upgraded node
Start the now upgraded node and confirm that it joins the cluster by checking the log file or by checking the output of this request:

GET _cat/nodes

Step 5: Reenable shard allocation

Once the node has joined the cluster, reenable shard allocation to start using the node:

PUT /_cluster/settings
{
  "transient": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "all"
  }
}

Step 6: Wait for the node to recover

You should wait for the cluster to finish shard allocation before upgrading the next node. You can check on progress with the _cat/health request:

GET _cat/health


Shards that have not been sync-flushed may take some time to recover. The recovery status of individual shards can be monitored with the _cat/recovery request:

GET _cat/recovery

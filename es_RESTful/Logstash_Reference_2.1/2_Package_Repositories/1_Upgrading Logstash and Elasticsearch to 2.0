Note: If you have custom template changes, please make sure to save it and merge any changes. You can get the existing template by running:

curl -XGET localhost:9200/_template/logstash
Add the following option to your Logstash config:

output {
        elasticsearch {
                template_overwrite => true
        }
}

bin/plugin update <plugin_name>

bin/plugin install logstash-filter-de_dot

Multiline Filter: If you are using the Multiline Filter in your configuration and upgrade to Logstash 2.0, you will get an error. Make sure to explicitly set the number of filter workers (-w) to 1. You can set the number of workers by passing a command line flag such as:

bin/logstash `-w 1`

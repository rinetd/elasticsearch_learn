Letâ€™s step through creating a simple config file and using it to run Logstash. Create a file named "logstash-simple.conf" and save it in the same directory as Logstash.

input { stdin { } }
output {
  elasticsearch { hosts => ["localhost:9200"] }
  stdout { codec => rubydebug }
}
Then, run logstash and specify the configuration file with the -f flag.

bin/logstash -f logstash-simple.conf

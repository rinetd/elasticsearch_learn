Configuring Filters

Filters are an in-line processing mechanism that provide the flexibility to slice and dice your data to fit your needs. Letâ€™s take a look at some filters in action. The following configuration file sets up the grok and date filters.

input { stdin { } }

filter {
  grok {
    match => { "message" => "%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}" }
  }
  date {
    match => [ "timestamp" , "dd/MMM/yyyy:HH:mm:ss Z" ]
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch { hosts => ["localhost:9200"] }
  stdout { codec => rubydebug }
}
